# Queries Example

1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM actor;
```

1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column `Actor Name`.

```sql
SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) AS "Actor Name"
FROM actor;
```

2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is
one query would you use to obtain this information?

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, actor_id
FROM actor
WHERE first_name = 'Joe';
```

2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters `GEN`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM actor
WHERE last_name ILIKE '%GEN%';
```

2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters `LI`. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that
order:

```sql
SELECT last_name, first_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name ILIKE '%LI%'
ORDER BY last_name, first_name;
```

2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:

```sql
SELECT country_id, country
FROM country
WHERE country IN ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China');
```

3a. Add a `middle_name` column to the table `actor`. Position it between `first_name` and `last_name`. Hint: you will need to
specify the data type.

```sql
ALTER TABLE actor
ADD middle_name VARCHAR(25) AFTER first_name;
```

3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the `middle_name` column to
`blobs`.

```sql
ALTER TABLE actor
MODIFY COLUMN middle_name blob;
```

3c. Now delete the `middle_name` column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE actor
DROP COLUMN middle_name;
```

4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name;
```

4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least
two actors.

```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

4c. Oh, no! The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`, the name of Harpo's
second cousin's husbands yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.

```sql
UPDATE actor
SET first_name = 'HARPO'
WHERE (first_name ILIKE 'GROUCHO' AND last_name ILIKE 'WILLIAMS');
```

4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! In a
single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`. Otherwise, change the first name to
`MUCHO GROUCHO`, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF
EVERY ACTOR TO `MUCHO GROUCHO`, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)

```sql
UPDATE actor
SET first_name =
CASE WHEN first_name = 'HARPO'
THEN 'GROUCHO'
ELSE 'MUCHO GROUCHO'
END
WHERE actor_id = 172;
```

5a. You cannot locate the schema of the `address` table. Which query would you use to re-create it?

```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE address;
```

6a. Use `JOIN` to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables `staff` and
`address`:

```sql
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, a.address
FROM staff s
INNER JOIN address a
ON (s.address_id = a.address_id);
```

6b. Use `JOIN` to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables `staff` and `payment`.

```sql
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, SUM(p.amount)
FROM staff s
INNER JOIN payment p
ON (s.staff_id = p.staff_id)
WHERE MONTH(p.payment_date) = 08 AND YEAR(p.payment_date) = 2005
GROUP BY s.staff_id;
```

6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables `film_actor` and `film`. Use inner join.

```sql
SELECT f.title, COUNT(a.actor_id) AS "Number of Actors"
FROM film f
INNER join film_actor a
ON (f.film_id = a.film_id)
GROUP BY f.title
ORDER BY 'Number of Actors' DESC;
```

6d. How many copies of the film `Hunchback Impossible` exist in the inventory system?

```sql
SELECT title, COUNT(inventory_id) AS "Number of copies"
FROM film
INNER JOIN inventory
USING (film_id)
WHERE title = 'Hunchback Impossible'
GROUP BY title;
```

6e. Using the tables `payment` and `customer` and the `JOIN` command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers
alphabetically by last name:

```sql
SELECT c.last_name, c.first_name, SUM(p.amount) AS "Total Amount Paid"
FROM customer c
INNER JOIN payment p
ON (c.customer_id = p.customer_id)
GROUP BY c.last_name
ORDER BY c.last_name;
```

7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with
the letters `K` and `Q` have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters
`K` and `Q` whose language is English.

```sql
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE title ILIKE 'K%'
OR title ILIKE 'Q%'
AND language_id IN
(SELECT language_id
FROM language
WHERE name = 'English'
);
```

7b. Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film `Alone Trip`.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE actor_id IN
(SELECT actor_id
FROM film_actor
WHERE film_id IN
(SELECT film_id
FROM film
WHERE title = 'Alone Trip'));
```

7c. You want to run an email marketing campaign in Canada, for which you will need the names and email addresses of all Canadian
customers. Use joins to retrieve this information.

```sql
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email
FROM customer c
JOIN address a ON (c.address_id = a.address_id)
JOIN city ci ON (a.city_id = ci.city_id)
JOIN country ctr ON (ci.country_id = ctr.country_id)
WHERE ctr.country ILIKE 'canada';
```

7d. Sales have been lagging among young families, and you wish to target all family movies for a promotion. Identify all movies
categorized as family films.

```sql
SELECT title, c.name
FROM film f
JOIN film_category fc
ON (f.film_id = fc.film_id)
JOIN category c
ON (c.category_id = fc.category_id)
WHERE name ILIKE 'family';
```

7e. Display the most frequently rented movies in descending order.

```sql
SELECT title, COUNT(title) as "Rentals"
FROM film
JOIN inventory
ON (film.film_id = inventory.film_id)
JOIN rental
ON (inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id)
GROUP by title
ORDER BY rentals desc;
```

7f. Write a query to display how much business, in dollars, each store brought in.

```sql
SELECT s.store_id, SUM(amount) AS "Revenue"
FROM payment p
JOIN rental r
ON (p.rental_id = r.rental_id)
JOIN inventory i
ON (i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id)
JOIN store s
ON (s.store_id = i.store_id)
GROUP BY s.store_id;
```

7g. Write a query to display for each store its store ID, city, and country.

```sql
SELECT store_id, city, country
FROM store s
JOIN address a
ON (s.address_id = a.address_id)
JOIN city cit
ON (cit.city_id = a.city_id)
JOIN country ctr
ON(cit.country_id = ctr.country_id);
```

7h. List the top five genres in gross revenue in descending order. (**Hint**: you may need to use the following tables: category,
film_category, inventory, payment, and rental.)

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) AS "Total Sales", c.name AS "Genre"
FROM payment p
JOIN rental r
ON (p.rental_id = r.rental_id)
JOIN inventory i
ON (r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id)
JOIN film_category fc
ON (i.film_id = fc.film_id)
JOIN category c
ON (fc.category_id = c.category_id)
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;
```

8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue. Use the
solution from the problem above to create a view. If you havent solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.

```sql
CREATE VIEW top_five_genres AS
SELECT SUM(amount) AS "Total Sales", c.name AS "Genre"
FROM payment p
JOIN rental r
ON (p.rental_id = r.rental_id)
JOIN inventory i
ON (r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id)
JOIN film_category fc
ON (i.film_id = fc.film_id)
JOIN category c
ON (fc.category_id = c.category_id)
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

8b. How would you display the view that you created in 8a?

```sql
SELECT *
FROM top_five_genres;
```

8c. You find that you no longer need the view `top_five_genres`. Write a query to delete it.

```sql
DROP VIEW top_five_genres;
```
